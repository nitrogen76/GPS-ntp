A note about gpsd and supportability:

Not all GPS modules are created equal.  In fact, many of the "BIG NAMES" commit grevious sins as far as following standards go.

Check out the gpsd [HALL OF SHAME](https://gpsd.io/hall-of-shame.html) to see what I mean.

In general, look at the [gpsd compatibility page](https://gpsd.io/hardware.html) for information on what to get.

My suggestion:

Get anything from ublox via sparkfun.

* [MAX-M10S](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/18037) would be a good low-cost option
* [NEO M9N](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/17285)
* [ZED-F9T](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/18774) would be excellent, but it's expensive.
* [GPS-RTK](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16481) another expensive option
* [Counterfeit NEO-6M GPS](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07P8YMVNT?th=1) works well enough, but I hate supporting piracy.
